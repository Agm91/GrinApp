# GrinApp
This was a test.

Basically, the application looks for nearby bluetooth devices and display them on the RecyclerView. You can upload each device using the WebServices.
You have a second screen were you can see all the uploaded devices and sort them by name, strength, date, etc.

Slightly deeper, I am using MVVM with Dagger2 and Retrofit2.
